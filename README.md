# Projects_recent
This repository contains all my recent projects.
app.py: contains the streamlit API code, I used for hosting my first online UI
Ronaldo_Messi_Classifier: This was one of the first image classifiers that I trained
Custom_trained: This is one of my recent projects which is related to MobileBERT LLM's implementation in a resource-constrained AI environment, I have custom trained this model to work with PDFs for now, and I am working on how to implement this over smaller sized microprocessors.
