# Projects_recent
This repository contains relevant code as an introduction to my preferred coding practices.

C-LSTMs: Contains my most recent project on combination of CNNs with LSTMs for anomaly detection and prediction on Human Activity Recognition problemset. Also includes additional code for the use of GRUs with CNN.

app.py: contains the streamlit API code, I used for hosting my first online UI

Ronaldo_Messi_Classifier: This was one of the first image classifiers that I trained

Custom_trained: This is one of my recent projects which is related to MobileBERT LLM's implementation in a resource-constrained AI environment, I have custom trained this model to work with PDFs for now, and I am currently working on how to implement this over smaller sized microprocessors.

Cycle_GAN: This is also one of my recent projects related to image generation using cycleGANs, this code is not complete (dependencies) and I have only provided a reference code of the main code file, there are several other code files that need to be used with this main file.
