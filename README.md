# Projects_recent
This repository contains relevant code as an introduction to my preferred coding practices.

app.py: contains the streamlit API code, I used for hosting my first online UI

Ronaldo_Messi_Classifier: This was one of the first image classifiers that I trained

Custom_trained: This is one of my recent projects which is related to MobileBERT LLM's implementation in a resource-constrained AI environment, I have custom trained this model to work with PDFs for now, and I am currently working on how to implement this over smaller sized microprocessors.

Cycle_GAN: This is also one of my recent projects related to image generation using cycleGANs, this code is not complete (dependencies) and I have only provided a reference code of the main code file, there are several other code files that need to be used with this main file.
